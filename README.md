#Taken rules from Boggle's wikipedia article.

Each player searches for words that fit the following criteria:

- Words must be at least three letters in length.
- Each letter after the first must be a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbor of the one before it.
- No individual letter cube may be used more than once in a word.
- No capitalized or hyphenated words are allowed.

We play on a 4x4 grid of randomized letters.
